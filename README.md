To run the code, firstly you need to fetch the data from yFinance by starting the server. 
I have used CORS here, To start the server, we need to have express, cors and axios in our systems.
If you don't have express, cores and axios, you can install them by the command given below

npm install express cors axios lightweight-charts@latest


You can now run the server by entering the following command

node server.cjs



Now, open another terminal and in another terminal start the project by using 

npm run dev
